GitHub was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[needs update]
Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and unregistered users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins have also been created by GitHub and other third parties that integrate with the platform.
