File
a folder or box for holding loose papers that are typically arranged in a particular order for easy reference.
A file is the common storage unit in a computer, and all programs and data are "written" into a file and "read" from a file. 
Folders provide a method for organizing files much like a manila file folder contains paper documents in a file cabinet. 
In fact, files that contain text are often called documents.
