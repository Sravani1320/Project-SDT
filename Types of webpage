From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic.
Static pages are retrieved from the web server's file system without any modification.  
Dynamic pages must be created by the web server on the fly, typically drawing from a database to fill out a web template, 
before being sent to the user's browser.
